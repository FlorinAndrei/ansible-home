This is a repository containing Ansible code for configuring a home network. Currently two systems are managed: gateway and server. Gateway is the local Internet router. Server runs typical local services. For each system, there are two playbooks: init and main. init performs minimal initial configuration. main is the main playbook. Secrets are kept in extra-vars.yml which is ignored by git.
