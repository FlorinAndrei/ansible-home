[defaults]
# (integer) Maximum number of forks Ansible will use to execute tasks on target hosts.
forks=5

# (string) Can be any connection plugin available to your ansible installation.
# There is also a (DEPRECATED) special 'smart' option, that will toggle between 'ssh' and 'paramiko' depending on controller OS and ssh versions.
transport=ssh

# (boolean) Set this to "False" if you want to avoid host key checking by the underlying connection plugin Ansible uses to connect to the host.
# Please read the documentation of the specific connection plugin used for details.
host_key_checking=True


[connection]
# (boolean) This is a global option, each connection plugin can override either by having more specific options or not supporting pipelining at all.
# Pipelining, if supported by the connection plugin, reduces the number of network operations required to execute a module on the remote server, by executing many Ansible modules without actual file transfer.
# It can result in a very significant performance improvement when enabled.
# However this conflicts with privilege escalation (become). For example, when using 'sudo:' operations you must first disable 'requiretty' in /etc/sudoers on all managed hosts, which is why it is disabled by default.
# This setting will be disabled if ``ANSIBLE_KEEP_REMOTE_FILES`` is enabled.
pipelining=True

# (string) Manage an SSH Agent via Ansible. A configuration of ``none`` will not interact with an agent, ``auto`` will start and destroy an agent via ``ssh-agent`` binary during the run, and a path to an SSH_AUTH_SOCK will allow interaction with a pre-existing agent.
ssh_agent=auto

# (str) When ``SSH_AGENT`` is ``auto``, the path or name of the ssh agent executable to start.
ssh_agent_executable=ssh-agent

# (int) For keys inserted into an agent defined by ``SSH_AGENT``, define a lifetime, in seconds, that the key may remain in the agent.
ssh_agent_key_lifetime=3600
